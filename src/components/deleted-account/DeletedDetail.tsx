          Violation of Terms of Service: Any user account found to be in
          violation of our Terms of Service will be subject to deletion. This
          includes actions such as engaging in illegal activities, promoting
          hate speech or violence, distributing explicit or harmful content, or
          any behavior that poses a threat to the safety and well-being of other
          users.

        <li>
          Breach of Community Guidelines: Our community guidelines exist to
          foster a respectful and inclusive environment for all users. Any
          account that repeatedly breaches these guidelines, including engaging
          in harassment, bullying, or any form of discriminatory behavior, may
          be deleted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spamming and Misuse: Accounts that engage in spamming activities, such
          as sending unsolicited commercial messages or repeatedly posting
          irrelevant or misleading content, may be subject to deletion.
          Additionally, any account found to be exploiting the platform for
          personal gain, including fraudulent activities or attempts to
          manipulate our systems, will be deleted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Impersonation or Unauthorized Use: Accounts that impersonate other
          individuals, organizations, or entities, or engage in unauthorized use
          of copyrighted materials, trademarks, or intellectual property, may
          face deletion. We take intellectual property rights seriously and
          expect our users to respect these rights as well.

        <li>
          Security Concerns: In cases where an account is compromised or poses a
          security risk to our platform or other users, we may delete the
          account to protect the overall security and integrity of our
          community.

        It is important to note that account deletions are not taken lightly and
        are only carried out after careful review and consideration by our team.
        We strive to ensure fair treatment and will investigate reported
        violations before taking action. In cases where an account deletion
        occurs, the user will be notified and provided with a general
        explanation for the action taken.
